=============== Description ===============

This website places you in the depths of 
the ocean, exploring different facts about 
our largest bodies of water, all while 
controlling your submarine. On this site, 
the cursor emits light, limiting visibility 
and having the user need to move and explore 
the depths of the website. What things can 
be learned in the depths beneath the surface?
